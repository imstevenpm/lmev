# lmev Project 2017/2018 V1.0

## Abstract

This work details the development of a computer simulation model for the Lego Mindstorms EV3 aimed at robotics students at the University of A Coruña, an initiative funded by the Grupo Integrado de Ingeniería. The robotic platform is 3D modeled and its mechanical and electronic components are studied to achieve their programmatic design through the Gazebo and ROS software. Several basic tools of the Lego Mindstorms EV3 are developed for their disposal in the simulation environment and the necessary documentation is prepared for their use and manipulation. The simulation results are validated by contrasting the behavior of the simulated robotic platform against the real one, at the level of sensors and actuators. Finally, a practical computational simulation model is obtained that is faithful to its real similarity, in terms of functionalities, physical sense and behavior.

## Notes
* This project was last tested on February, 2018 using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Gazebo 7.x & ROS Kinetic Kame.
* This was part of my bachelor thesis back in 2017, so the full description and user guide for the project are in Spanish.
* The project was continued later by Miguel Herran who used it for an application of evolutionary algorithms, you can find his work [here](https://bitbucket.org/n1ghtm4r1sh911/simulation-environment-of-evolutionary-robotics-on-ros/src/master/).
